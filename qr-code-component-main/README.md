## My process

- First I've decided about Div's. Then I've failed many times about QR in specific div and how to center that. I've searched in Google about solutions. I guess my margin and padding settings wont work in responsive but I still don't know why when I center a div its randomly 2500x2500 resolution when I didn't send any content in it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties



**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- I've recalled CSS properties such as display: inline-block; , justify-content, padding, margin,

- How to work with DIV's better


### Continued development

- I should be more comfortable with CSS properties like margin, padding. Yet I'm still incapable of aligning items properly in CSS.
